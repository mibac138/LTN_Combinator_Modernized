[mod-setting-description]
suppress-custom-gui=If an update to LogisticTranNetwork creates conflicts with LTN Combinators, enable this option to use the vanilla GUI for constant combinators.
high-provide-threshold=Set a high provide threshold for Requester stations, automatically. This prevents trains trying to load items at a Requester station in case of an overfill.
show-all-panels=Always show Requester and Provider setings regardles of detected stop type.  A depot will still hide all settgins.
ltnc-upgradable=Considered an upgraded tier of the constant combinator.  A default upgrade planner will mark constant comibnators to be upgraded to LTN Combinators.\n\nThis does not affect fast upgrade.
